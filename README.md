# Pendulum-model

The Xcos model shows the model of a pendulum with viscous angular friction and a motor that applies torque to the joint, with the following assumptions:

- The rod has no mass, is rigid and is not extensible.
- The object at the end can be considered a point mass.

The Scilab script simulates the model and plots the result.

The parameters used are:

m = 0.5 kg
l = 1 m
k = 0.5 Nm*s
g = 9.81 m/s^2

The model was created to support a Linkedin post. Follow me on Linkedin! https://www.linkedin.com/in/simone-bertoni-control-eng/
